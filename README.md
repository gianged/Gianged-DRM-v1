# Gianged-DRM-v1

## Learning Purpose Project

This project is designed as an **educational exercise** to understand and implement basic Digital Rights Management (DRM) concepts in C#/.NET. It serves as a hands-on learning experience to explore software protection mechanisms, licensing systems, and security concepts.

> **Educational Disclaimer**: This project is created solely for learning purposes. It demonstrates basic DRM concepts and should not be used in production environments without proper security auditing and enhancements.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the fundamentals of software licensing and protection
- Learn about cryptographic techniques in software security
- Explore hardware fingerprinting and machine identification
- Implement basic anti-debugging and integrity checking mechanisms
- Practice software architecture patterns for security systems

## Technologies Used

- **Framework**: .NET 8.0
- **Language**: C#
- **Dependencies**:
  - `Microsoft.Win32.Registry` - Windows registry access
  - `Newtonsoft.Json` - JSON serialization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code
- Windows OS (for registry-based features)

### Building the Project

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gianged/Gianged-DRM-v1.git
cd Gianged-DRM-v1

# Build the solution
dotnet build

# Run the application
dotnet run --project DRM
```

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. License Management
- License generation and validation
- Feature-based licensing
- Expiration handling

### 2. Hardware Fingerprinting
- Machine identification
- Hardware-based license binding
- System information collection

### 3. Cryptographic Protection
- License encryption/decryption
- Digital signatures
- Hash verification

### 4. Anti-Tampering Measures
- Anti-debugging techniques
- Code integrity checking
- Obfuscation methods

### 5. Secure Storage
- Encrypted license storage
- Registry-based persistence
- Secure data handling

## Security Considerations

This learning project implements basic security concepts. In a real-world scenario, additional considerations include:

- Advanced cryptographic algorithms
- Server-side license validation
- Network security protocols
- Robust anti-tampering measures
- Professional code obfuscation
- Legal compliance (DMCA, etc.)
